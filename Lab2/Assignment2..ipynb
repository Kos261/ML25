    "# **Homework Assignment: EM Clustering in 2D**\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Kos261/ML25/blob/main/Lab2/Assignment2.ipynb)\n",

    "You have seen how the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm can fit a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to a 2D dataset. You should now explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Primary Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can we visualize the *decision boundary* for attributing a *new* (unlabeled) point to one of the GMM clusters?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, given a 2D data distribution modeled by EM, think of a way to clearly show (on a plot) *which* cluster a point would be assigned to (or which cluster has the highest responsibility (posterior probability) for that point)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The plot should comprehensively cover the entire visible region, ensuring that for any point on the plot, it is immediately evident which cluster it would belong to. You can plot **lines** separating clusters or use a **color map** showing each point's \"most likely cluster\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can illustrate your approach with **the same** 2D dataset that we used in class, or you can find another suitable 2D dataset, it's up to you. Note however, that having 3 clusters enhances the clarity of the visualization—while 2 clusters result in overly simple boundaries, using 4 or more clusters can make the entire plot difficult to interpret. Try to choose a dataset with 3 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss any irregularities observed in the resulting plot. If a decision boundary suggests that a region should be attributed to a cluster in a counterintuitive way (we saw it in class!), provide an explanation for why this might occur. It may be also an indication you have a bug in your code.\n"

    "   - Place the Colab notebook in your **GitHub repository** for this course.\n",
